<h1>Opus-5</h1>
Opus-5 is a setup script generating web-app. U can easily choose what do u want (e.g.: docker, nginx, etc.) and it will automatically generate setup script, so u no longer need to think about how to install anything, u just have to start a script.

<hr>
This is a selfhosted ecosystem of application.<br>

<h2>Design</h2> 
OS:<br>
GNU/Linux, Ubuntu server 22.04

5) Moodle: for students learning<br>
6) Lecture collections: Ghost, ig <br>
7) File browser: for files transition <br>
