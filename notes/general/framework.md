<h1>Framework</h1>
A framework is a generic term commonly referring to an essential supporting structure which other things are built on top of.<br>
library is a set of previously-written code that you can use to build your own code. A framework is a supporting structure that requires specificity. You must follow the pattern of the framework.
<br>
A framework is essentially a skeleton, and you work with the skeleton. A framework calls on your code. Your code calls on a library. In other words, your code is in control when you use a library, but when you use a framework, it's in control. This is referred to as "inversion of control."
Frameworks can, and often do, include libraries. Libraries are used to fill out functions.
