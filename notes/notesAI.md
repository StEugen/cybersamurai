# Some philosophical notes about AI

Don't judge it hard, this is just some of my thoughts about AI. I will try to express them from some philosophical prospective, from the time when i was a kind of philosopher. I will try to make them somehow "scientific" but i do not promise they will be scientific. Sometimes it will be just me, my feelings and thoughts.




## Loneliness 

"No one to understand, no one to talk to... " - this is the state of humanity. The most horrible problem faced by people today is complete loneliness. Technologies, our whole modern world make our psycho-state far more upper than any animal has, but this came at price, understanding that we are alone. People always can find someone to talk to, somebody "other", not like "myself". And this is essential necessity of every human being, we all want but one thing - someone to understand us because when we are talking to another man, we can find something about ourselves, we can find acceptance, we can find disagreement, that's what we are eager for. But talking about human as population... We are alone.

There are no aliens, no animals, completely nothing to understand us as species, and maybe here AI will trully help. AI it's something Intelegent, something that can talk to us, understand, it's something with mind like we have but still it's not a human... it's somebody "other" we want to talk to. And maybe dialogues with AI will help humans to find somebody in this outer space we are drifting in.
