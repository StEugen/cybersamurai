1.Firstly, we need to clone the required alphine git repo and build it on our machine(Attacker)
2.Once we build it, we will have a compressed image file in tar format.
3. We need to make a script which exploit the lxd group and send both of them to victim machine.
4. Change the permission of the script and run it.
5. Once you run the script, it will import the image and create the container with elevated access.
6. Since the image have the admin access and it will mount the whole victim machine's root disk and give complete access.
7. Now since we are root in this image with having access to our victim's machine's root directory, we can navigate it and get our final flag
