1. Firstly, we need to clone the required alphine git repo and build it on our machine(Attacker) <br>
2. Once we build it, we will have a compressed image file in tar format. <br>
3. We need to make a script which exploit the lxd group and send both of them to victim machine. <br>
4. Change the permission of the script and run it. <br>
5. Once you run the script, it will import the image and create the container with elevated access. <br>
6. Since the image have the admin access and it will mount the whole victim machine's root disk and give complete access. <br> 
7. Now since we are root in this image with having access to our victim's machine's root directory, we can navigate it and get our final flag <br>
