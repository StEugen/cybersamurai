<h1>REST</h1>
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between separate (physically!) components. 
In another words REST is a set of rules how programmers should organize code of server app, so all systems can easily exchange data and size.
<br>
Features of REST:<br>
<ul>
<li> Efficiency: components' interactions of system is a dominant factor of efficiency and effectivity of net </li>
<li>Scalability: for making a lot of components and components' interactions</li></ul>
Roy Fielding describes REST influence on scale:
<ul>
<li>Simplicity of a unified interface</li>
<li>Openness of components to possible changes to meet need (even when app is running)</li>
<li>Transparency of connections between system components for service daemons</li>
<li>portability of system components by moving program code along with data</li>
<li>Reliability, expressed in resistance to failures at the system level in the presence of failures of individual components, connections or data</li>
</ul>
<br>
Requirements to REST architecture:
<ol>
<li>Client-server model: The first limitation applicable to the hybrid model is to bring the architecture to the client-server model. Differentation between needs is a principle.  </li>
