## Bots 

## what bot exactly is? 
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot for more info)
An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet, usually with the intent to imitate human activity on the Internet, such as messaging, on a large scale. <br>
An Internet bot plays the client role in a clientâ€“server model whereas the server role is usually played by web servers. Internet bots are able to perform tasks, that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could ever do. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots. <br>
Bots can be: <br>
- Chatbots: Bots that simulate human conversation by responding to certain phrases with programmed responses
- Web crawlers (Googlebots): Bots that scan content on webpages all over the Internet
- Social bots: Bots that operate on social media platforms
- Malicious bots: Bots that scrape content, spread spam content, or carry out credential stuffing attacks
