<h1>Representations</h1>
Computers have zeros and ones (0 and 1)<br>
000 is 0 
001 is 1
010 is 2 
All of these is binary, decimal system
Why? because computers use electicity, it has only on or off. Computers have transistors which switch on and off, so represent somthing. <br>
4 2 1 
0 0 0  principe of counting. We have 4 times 0, 2 times 0 and 1 times 0, so it is 0.
4 2 1 
0 0 1 we have 4 times 0, 2 times 0 and 1 times 1, so it is 1<br>
Computer use at least 8 transistors. <br>
How computers represents letters? <br>
We represent letters with numbers. A is 65, 01000001 <br>
People decided that different formats represent different information using binary. like in excel it's about numbers (.xsls) and in photoshop about image (.png). So, we give computer hints to represent this information as we want.<br>
ASCII - is standart for coding all this. <br> 
72        73        33 
H          I        !  
01001000  01001001  00100001 <br>
Computers are designed to understand it. <br>
emojis also has some standart >> Unicode. <br>
Unicode is like ASCII but has a lot more characters. <br>
Colors can be represented by RGB. Pixels uses rgb pattern to determine it's color. <br>
How to represent videos?<br>
Video is images going through time >> motion <br>
Music is the same, can be represented in numbers. <br>
input -> algorithm -> output <br>
Programming is not about making a whole new world but to represent the world in a new more suffiecient way. <br>
Different algorithms can be used to optimize amount of time we have to spend on solving a problem. <br>
<h1>Pseudocode</h1> - is not a code, it's the way to describe algorithms using human language. <br>
1 Pick up phone book
2 Open to middle of phone book
3 Look at page
4 If person is on page
5	Call person
6 Elif person is earlier in book
7	Open to middle of left half of book
8 	Go back to line 3 
9 Elif person later in book
10	Open to middle of right half of book
11	Go back to line 3 
12 Else
13	Quit
<br>
We should define everything, if 12 and 13 lines from example is not defined, than we don't know what to do. <br>
Functions - words that can solve small problems, specific.  <br>
Conditionals - things we do conditionaly. <br>
Boolean expression - True of False questions <br>
Loops - directives to do something again and again <br>
